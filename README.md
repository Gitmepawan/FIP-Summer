# Assignment Overview
The Midterm assignment is based on the Final Integrated Project (FIP). Each course this semester
will require students to create certain criteria for their FIP and submit it by the midpoint (Midterm) of
the semester. The goal of the Midterm is to aid students in creating, developing and finishing a
successful FIP project at the end of the semester.


# Assignment Requirements
Create a well-written readme for your FIP.
Follow best practices RE workflow FROM THE BEGINNING of the project - branches, pull
requests, commits etc.
NEVER work directly on the main branch - you should have at least 3 for the midterm (main branch
and a working branch with commits per team member)
If you have any further questions, please email your instructor. Ask questions in class!

# About Orbitz drink.
Orbitz was a noncarbonated fruit-flavored beverage product made by The Clearly Food & Beverage Company of Canada, makers of Clearly Canadian. 
The small balls floated due to their nearly equal density to the surrounding liquid, and remained suspended with assistance from an ingredient known as gellan gum. The gellan gum provided a support matrix and had a visual clarity approaching that of water, which increased with the addition of sugar.
